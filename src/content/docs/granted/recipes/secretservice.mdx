title: "Linux (preferred): Encrypting AWS SSO Tokens using a keyring"
---

Granted uses an [open-source library](https://github.com/99designs/keyring) to securely store AWS SSO tokens in a backend service. Linux desktop users can generally use a keyring to securely store AWS SSO tokens, and get it unlocked with the default `login` keychain.

Your desktop probably already has a keyring installed by default. If this is not the case, you either need to install one (look online for "\<desktop-name\> keyring") or use pass.

## Prerequisites

- Installed Granted CLI tool.
- Access to AWS SSO tokens.
- A compatible Linux desktop:
  - Gnome (Gnome Keyring)
  - KDE (Kwallet)
  - Cinnamon/Linux Mint (Gnome Keyring)
- Or a FreeDesktop Secret Service compatible program:
  - Gnome Keyring (Gnome/GTK-desktops)
  - Kwallet (KDE)
  - KeePassXC (desktop-agnostic)

## Configuration

Open the Granted configuration file located at `~/.granted/config`. Add the following configuration to specify the backend for keyring:

```
[Keyring]
  Backend = "secret-service"
  LibSecretCollectionName = "login"
```

Next time you run Granted, it will use the `secret-service` backend to store AWS SSO tokens and it will not ask you to enter your password. It will unlock it with the `login` keychain instead.

To learn more about how to configure the keyring, check out [these settings](https://github.com/common-fate/granted/blob/bcf79899f282cceff6313f1757d963e4dbbf44e1/pkg/config/config.go#L58-L63) that are exposed in Granted and the upstream [library documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/99designs/keyring?utm_source=godoc) for further details.
