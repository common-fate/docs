## Snowflake Integration

Common Fate integrates with Snowflake to grant/revoke database access when access is requested and approved.

To configure the Snowflake integration, Common Fate requires a Snowflake account with `ACCOUNTADMIN` role or `SECURITYADMIN` role to create the necessary service account and role.

We create a dedicated integration user with minimal permissions instead of using `ACCOUNTADMIN` to follow the principle of least privilege. This integration user will only have permissions to:

    - View users and databases
    - Create and manage roles
    - Grant and revoke roles

## Prerequisites

1. Log in to Snowflake at https://app.snowflake.com
2. Switch to ACCOUNTADMIN or SECURITYADMIN role by running:

```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
```

3. Run the following commands line by line to create the integration role and user:

```sql
-- Create the integration role for Common Fate to manage Snowflake access
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS COMMONFATE_INTEGRATION_ROLE;

-- Allow the role to manage role grants and revokes
GRANT MANAGE GRANTS ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE COMMONFATE_INTEGRATION_ROLE;

-- Allow the role to create new roles
GRANT CREATE ROLE ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE COMMONFATE_INTEGRATION_ROLE;

-- Allow the role to use the default warehouse
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH TO ROLE COMMONFATE_INTEGRATION_ROLE;

-- Allow the role to manage database roles. Note that you will need to execute this for each database you have.
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE <DATABASE_NAME> TO ROLE COMMONFATE_INTEGRATION_ROLE;

-- Create the service user that Common Fate will use
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS COMMONFATE_INTEGRATION_USER
   PASSWORD = '<choose_a_secure_password>'
   DEFAULT_ROLE = COMMONFATE_INTEGRATION_ROLE
   MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = FALSE;

-- Grant the integration role to the service user
GRANT ROLE COMMONFATE_INTEGRATION_ROLE TO USER COMMONFATE_INTEGRATION_USER;

-- Verify the configuration
SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE COMMONFATE_INTEGRATION_ROLE;
SHOW GRANTS TO USER COMMONFATE_INTEGRATION_USER;
```

4. You can use the AWS CLI to create a secret in the region you are deploying to, you must use the following path `"/<namespace>/<stage>/<secret name>"`

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name "/common-fate/prod/snowflake-password" \
    --value "<insert the secure password of created integration user>" \
    --type "SecureString"
```

5. Run these commands to get the required connection details:

```sql
-- Get account identifier and region
SELECT
    current_account() as account_id,
    REGEXP_REPLACE(
        LOWER(
            REGEXP_REPLACE(current_region(), '^(AWS|AZURE|GCP)_', '')
        ),
        '_',
        '-'
    ) as region;
```

6. In your configuration Terraform, add the following into your `main.tf` file

```hcl
resource "commonfate_snowflake_integration" "snowflake_integration" {
  name                = "Snowflake"
  account_id           = "<account-id>"
  region               = "<region>"
  username             = "<username of created integration user>"
  password_secret_path = "/common-fate/prod/snowflake-password"
}

```

- Account ID: Use the account_id from the query result in step 5
- Region: Use the region from the query result in step 5
- Username: Use the username of the integration user created in step 3. If you ran the commands as is, it would be `COMMONFATE_INTEGRATION_USER`

## Provisioning access to Snowflake Account

To make a Snowflake account available for Just-In-Time (JIT) access you can add a `commonfate_snowflake_account_availability` resource to your Common Fate application Terraform code.

You'll need to use the `commonfate_snowflake_account_availability` in conjunction with a `commonfate_access_workflow` resources.

Snowflake Account Availability

```hcl
resource "commonfate_snowflake_account_availability" "snowflake_account" {
  workflow_id            = commonfate_access_workflow.snowflake.id
  snowflake_account_role = "ORGADMIN"
  snowflake_account_id   = "AB12345"
}
```

Access workflow

```hcl
resource "commonfate_access_workflow" "snowflake" {
  name                    = "Snowflake"
  access_duration_seconds = 60 * 60 * 10
  priority                = 3
}
```

## Provisioning access to Snowflake Database

To make Snowflake databases available for Just-In-Time (JIT) access you can add a `commonfate_snowflake_database_selector` [Selector](/config/selectors) resource to your Common Fate application Terraform code. As shown below, the `when` clause in the resource is a [Cedar](https://cedarpolicy.com/) expression. You can use any [Cedar operator](https://docs.cedarpolicy.com/policies/syntax-operators.html) in the `when` clause, such as `&&` and `||` to combine conditions.

You'll need to use the `commonfate_snowflake_database_selector` in conjunction with a `commonfate_snowflake_database_availabilities` and `commonfate_access_workflow` resources.

Snowflake Database Selector

```hcl
resource "commonfate_snowflake_database_selector" "snowflake_db" {
  id                   = "snowflake_db_selector"
  name                 = "Database ABC"
  snowflake_account_id = "AB12345"
  when                = <<EOT
  resource == Snowflake::Database::"replace-this-with-your-database-name"
  EOT
}
```

Snowflake Database Availability

```hcl
resource "commonfate_snowflake_database_availabilities" "snowflake_db" {
  workflow_id                    = commonfate_access_workflow.snowflake.id
  snowflake_database_role        = "DATABASE_ROLE_NAME"
  snowflake_database_selector_id = commonfate_snowflake_database_selector.snowflake_db.id
}

```

Access workflow

```hcl
resource "commonfate_access_workflow" "snowflake" {
  name                    = "Snowflake"
  access_duration_seconds = 60 * 60 * 10
  priority                = 3
}
```
