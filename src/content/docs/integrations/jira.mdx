## Jira and Common Fate

Common Fate integrates with Jira to provide additional context to access request justifications.

## Prerequisites

To set up Jira in your Common Fate deployment, create an app within your Atlassian developer console.

1. Log into the [Atlassian developer portal](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps) with an admin user. 

2. Click **Create** then select **Oauth 2.0 integration.**

3. Name the integration **Common Fate** and give any description you want. As an example: **Common Fate allows assigning just in time access to users in on-call schedules with PagerDuty.**

4. Add permission scopes for Jira API access.

5. Select **View Jira issue data** then save.

6. Navigate to the Authorization tab, click **Add** then set the callback URL to `https://<Your Common Fate Deployment URL>/api/v1/oauth2/callback/jira`

7. Navigate to Settings, copy the **Client Secret** value and save is as a secret in AWS Parameter Store, also make note of the **Client ID**.

You can use the AWS CLI to create a secret in the region you are deploying to, you must use the following path `"/<namespace>/<stage>/<secret name>"`

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name "/common-fate/prod/jira-client-secret" \
    --value "mySecretValue" \
    --type "SecureString"
```

5. In your configuration Terraform, add the following into your `main.tf` file

```hcl
resource "commonfate_jira_integration" "jira" {
  name                = "Jira"
  client_secret_secret_path = "/common-fate/prod/jira-client-secret"
  client_id = "<Your jira application client ID>"
}

```

6. Run a deployment

```hcl
terraform apply
```

## Add a Jira ticket to an access request

When requesting access via the Common Fate console, you can type "@" followed by the name of your ticket in Jira to mention it in your request.
