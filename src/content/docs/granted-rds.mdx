The Granted AWS RDS Plugin integrates with the [Common Fate](https://commonfate.io) access platform, allowing you to broker a connection to an AWS RDS database over [AWS SSM Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html). The connection is routed through a [Common Fate AWS Proxy](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/common-fate/common-fate-proxy-ecs/aws/latest) which runs on AWS Fargate and captures audit logs of the SQL statements executed.

Connecting to a database is as simple as running:

```bash
granted rds proxy
```

Audit logs of SQL commands executed are logged and can be streamed to an AWS S3 bucket.
